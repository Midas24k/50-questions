  # Description:
  This application came about, by the way of a school challenge project. The README.md gernerater does as its name implies to give the user a professional README file in a fraction of the time. It is preinstalled with a structured outline that allows the user to be descriptive without adding extra fluff.This application will continue to devlope as my needs change and is open to anyone to do the same.
